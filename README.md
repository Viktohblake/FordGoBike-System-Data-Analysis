## by (Victor Onoja)


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.

> I checked and fix for Duplicates, Null values/column, Wrong datatype in dataset.


## Summary of Findings

> Average trip in seconds: The trip duration is on a average is mostly on the lower side of the x axis which is 'duration in seconds'. the longest trip is around duration of 5000 (seconds) the above visualization it is not concised enough since it's in seconds so I checkd further in minutes as this will be clear enough.

> Average trip in minutes: This showed that there's a peak of average trip duration around the 10minute area. Meaning majority people use bikes for a short period of time.

> Most trips During the hour of the day: People like to start their bike trip in the early hour of the day with a peak at 8am, during mid-day there's a steady and a bit low equilibrum in the number of trips taken, towards the late hour of the day there's another peak by 5pm and slightly higher than the peak of the early hour of the day.

> Most trips During the day of the week: Most people like going biking on Thursday. Weekends (Sun & Sat) appears to have less bike trips than the rest of the day. Most people don't like biking during the weekend.

> Subscriber and Customer count: 90.5% of users are Subscribers, while 9.5% of users are Customers. The majority of users who uses ford go bike sharing platform are Subscribers

> Distribution of Age: The older people get, the lesser they ride bikes.

> Gender count: 'Male' gender took more trips than 'female' and 'other' gender category.

> Top 10 Most common places for starting a trip: 'Market St at 10th St' is where most trips are taken.

> Do members like sharing their bike for all trip?: No, for majority.

> What is the relationship between daily trip for user type?: Subscribers take more daily trips compared to Customers.

> Duration and age: Higher trip duration is clocked by younger users.

> User type and gender: This further shows how subscriber count is more than customer, with Male gender as majority.

> Duration and user type: Customers take long trips than subscribers.

> Trip duration across user type in different time of the day: Peak longer trips were in the midnight hours, and mostly by customers.

> Member gender and user trips in diferent day of the week: > Subscribers have more daily trips with a peak in all gender on Thursday.

> Age and duration with gender: There is a high the correlation between the age, duration and gender variable.

> Age and duration with user type: There is a high the correlation between the age, duration and gender variable.

> Start time of day and duration (in min) with gender and user_type: Suprisinly, 'other' and 'female' gender category who are customers have longer trips than 'male'... Also they take most of their trips in the early time of the day roughly by 12am - 5am which further proof our 'Trip duration across user type in different time of the day' finding that shows longer trip duration happens in the early hours of the day.Â¶
